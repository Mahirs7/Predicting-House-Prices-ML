# Predicting-House-Prices-ML

Web app using Streamlit for predicting house prices. To predict house prices I used regression models from scikit-learn. RandomForestRegressor and GradientBoostingRegressor had the best accuracies with right under 90%. 

The webapp has a predictions page where users can input values such as bedrooms, square feet, etc to get the predicted price of the house. There's also a page for data exploration.
